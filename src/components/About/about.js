            <p className='pb-4'>My love of all things software development began in university where (after initially applying to a Life Sciences degree) I took an Intro to Coding course, fell in love, and changed my major immediately. I graduated from York University in April 2020 with a Hons. Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
            <p className='pb-4'>It's been a long journey since that first course and I've loved every step of it! I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Publicis Sapient where I am focusing on building accessible and performant applications with Salesforce.</p>
            <p className='pb-4'>In my free time, I love to read, bake, expand my Pok√©mon figurine collection, and learn about cool new technologies.</p>
            <p className='pb-4'>Please explore this site and feel free to contact me should you have any questions or comments!</p>
